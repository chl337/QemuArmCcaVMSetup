# Qemu Arm-CCA VM Setup

Setup a Qemu VM that emulates HW with Arm-CCA capabilities. A guest inside the VM
can use the KVM API to launch a Realm-VM.

## SW-Stack
Run 'python qemu_rme_setup.py' to pull and build the needed SW-Stack:
        * TF-A: L3 - Root FW
        * TF-RMM: L2 - Realm Management Monitor
        * Linux: With CCA support
        * ubuntu_fs.sh: Script to generate an Ubuntu22.04 image

## Qemu launch
Run 'qemu_launch_host.sh' to launch the VM.
 - Precondition: Open two terminals, each listening to port: 5432{3,4}.
        - Adjust ports / IPs as it fits your system best.
